        <p className='text'> Hi there! I am a passionate and highly-motivated
        software engineer with experience in software engineering, machine
        learning, and full-stack web development. I am currently a student at
        Santa Clara University studying Computer Science &amp; Engineering and
        Mathematics. I am grateful to have gotten the opportunity of working with
        incredible teams at Nike and Headspin doing research and engineering work.
        Lately, I have been excited to get more into React and develop my expertise
        with artificial intelligence in Python. Check out some of my recent projects
        to see what I've been up to! </p>
